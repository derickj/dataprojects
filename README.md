## Introduction

This peer assessed assignment provides a simple Shiny application, deployed to Rstudio's servers, as well as a reproducuble pitch created with Slidify.

## Part 1 Shiny Application

The application allows the user to visualise the racial composition of enrollments at South African universities over the
years 2000 to 2012.

In order to use the application, the user can select a year and a number of universities to compare the data across the universities for the specific year.  Nothing is displayed until at least one university (abbreviated) name is selected.

A further input parameter, selected from a dropdown list, allows the user to pick a single university to view the changing trend in enrollments over the period covered by the data.  Nothing is displayed until the default choice is changed.

The application is hosted on shinyapps.io at:  
  https://derickj.shinyapps.io/dataprojects/
and the Github repo containing the source is at:
